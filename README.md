### Phonebook
This is my submission for the part 3 exercises of the FullStackOpen course. 

The phonebook app allows users to add names and numbers, modify the numbers of previously saved people and delete people. It also allows users to search for particular names using a filter.

The frontend built was built with React, and the backend was built with NodeJS and Express, which consists of a REST API. MongoDB was used for the database. 

The app is deployed on Render: https://phonebook-gfw2.onrender.com/
